          <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
         </div>
         <p class="service-text">
            In the past three years I have grown a great passion for climbing. It 
            enhanced my problem solving skills, made me more confident, committed and 
            determined. Although climbing might seem like a very physical sport it actually 
            requires lots of thinking and problem solving in order to finish the climb. When 
            I fall, I go back and examine what I did wrong and try different strategies till 
            I get it right. It also increased my patience and taught me to keep trying and never
            give up no matter what.

        <p class="service-text">
            I enjoy expanding my knowledge on topics that interest me, like fitness/nutrition,
            investing, programming, learning languages and expanding my skills in design software.
            Learning new things allows me to be well rounded and be able to succeed in the real world
            by having knowledge on different topics that I can apply to different events and scenarios.

            I constantly try to stay active and nourish my body, I have many fitness goals that I work on daily. 
            Having goals and accomplishing them keeps my mentality strong and helps me stay motivated. Being involved
            in different activities fills up my schedule allowing me to stay busy and organize my time in order to finish
            and accomplish all my tasks outside and inside of school.

         <h3>Designing</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="service-text">
            I love using my creativity and skills to design 
            and develop new and unique items. I got into designing 
            during quarantine by teaching myself how to use design softwares 
            like Photpshop, Illustrator, and Indesign. I then took my interest
            to the next level by making a profile on Upwork in order to design 
            for people. That's where I got my first job, where I made a 22-page planner for
            my client's business. Visit my profile here. https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01b9c1cf0d9aabcefa?viewMode=1

             <h3>Programming</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="service-text">
            I got into programming over a year ago, and taking computer science in the 
            11th grade really ignited my interest. I really enjoy programming, in fact I 
            built this website myself using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Although this website
            is still work in progress, I am really proud of what I have done with it so far
            and I am excited to see how I can expand it. I also worked on other personal projects
            like making a flappy bird game using JS. I am currently expanding my knowledge on python 
            since it is the language I am using to write the CCC.

         <h3>Traveling</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="service-text">
            I really enjoy traveling and exploring the amazing and diverse parts of this world.
            I have traveled to Germany, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA, and France. I am planning 
            on expanding this list starting with Japan this summer. Traveling opened my eyes to the different
            geography around the world, and really broadened my horizon on how the people and their cultures and 
            traditions are beautiful and unique in their own way, not to mention the scenic lands themselves that
            give life to those peoples.
